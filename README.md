# SQL-PIVOT-UNPIVOT

**Pivoting and unpivoting are operations used to transform data in SQL.**

**Pivot:** Transform rows into columns. This is useful when you want to aggregate data and present it in a cross-tabulated format.

Working: Aggregates data based on one or more columns and spreads the aggregated values into new columns.

Use Case: Displaying sales data where each row represents a product, and columns represent different months with sales amounts.

**Unpivot:** Transform columns into rows. This is useful when you need to normalize data or convert wide-format tables into a more traditional row-based format.

Working: Converts multiple columns into a single column with an additional column that indicates the original column names.

Use Case: Normalizing a table where each column represents a different month’s sales data into a format where each row represents a single month’s sales data.
